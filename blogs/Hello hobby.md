As a software engineer, I have a passion for coding and building software applications. I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving complex problems, and constantly learning and improving my skills. In my free time, I also like to contribute to open-source projects and participate in coding competitions. Programming is not just my profession, but also my favorite hobby!

## Playing FIFA
Apart from coding, I also enjoy playing FIFA online or FIFA 23 on my PS5. It's a great way for me to relax and have fun. Competing with other players and experiencing the thrill of virtual football matches is something I really enjoy. It's a perfect hobby to balance out my programming endeavors.

## Coffee
In addition to my coding and gaming hobbies, I am also a coffee enthusiast. I love exploring different coffee flavors and brewing methods. Whether it's a rich espresso or a smooth pour-over, the aroma and taste of coffee never fail to energize me. It's the perfect companion during long coding sessions and a delightful way to start my day. Cheers to the perfect blend of technology and caffeine!
