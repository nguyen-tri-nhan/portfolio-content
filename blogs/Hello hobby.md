# My hobbies
As a software engineer, I have a passion for coding and building software applications. I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving complex problems, and constantly learning and improving my skills. In my free time, I also like to contribute to open-source projects and participate in coding competitions. Programming is not just my profession, but also my favorite hobby!

## Playing FIFA
Apart from coding, I also enjoy playing FIFA online or FIFA 23 on my PS5. It's a great way for me to relax and have fun. Competing with other players and experiencing the thrill of virtual football matches is something I really enjoy. It's a perfect hobby to balance out my programming endeavors.
